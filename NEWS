15

* New translations added via Pootle

14

* (Note : This release doesn't comply with Bitfrost. Please see AnalogInput.py to correct that)
* Revisited Journal Integration - now scale, mode etc. are also written in logfile
* Details show/hide added - rms, avg, X Axis scale and Y Axis scale are visible
* Fixed #3616 by making the Activity wait for ,active = True to fire before trying to get hold of the sound device
* Increased gain slider sensitivity, also disabled Mic Boost throughout Activity

13

* Changing sampling rate from ALSA rather than using downsampling in code
* Frequency slider now takes three discrete values
